## Description
This budget tracking app allows the user to enter transactions, positive and negative, to keep track of cash flow. Each transaction has a description and an amount. In order to keep the application functional even if a connection to the internet is lost, the application uses IndexedDB to store the transactions that happen while offline, and puts them back into play when the conenction returns.
